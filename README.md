## 2. Running the Demo

1. Just run with MATLAB

## 3. Python example (nonlinear dynamics)

Only with PGM-DS and PGM-DU. The comparison with other filters and MC simulation are not considered in this code. All structure is the same as the Matlab code but just for the easy embedding for other environment.

## 3. Version Information

* 4th Sep 2024 Beta 0.0 Version: First Commit
* 23rd Oct 2024 Beta 0.1 Version: Simple Python example added
